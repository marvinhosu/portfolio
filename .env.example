# Generate a SHA-256 hash of your password using:
# echo -n "your-secure-password" | sha256sum

# This .env.example file shows the format only.
#
# The default hash below is for "password" - DO NOT use in production!

# 2. Generate your own hash with: echo -n "your-password" | sha256sum
# 3. Replace the hash above with your generated hash
# 4. For production deployment, set PUBLIC_PASSWORD_HASH in your platform's environment variables
